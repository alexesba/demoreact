## Instructions

 After clone the repository we need to install all dependencies by running the next commands
 on the terminal:

 ```sh
    #on your app directory
    npm install
    bower install
 ```

 #### Compiling the styles and javascript files

 ```sh
    $ gulp
    [13:36:29] Starting 'bower'...
    [13:36:29] Using cwd:  /Users/crowdint/Sites/demoreact
    [13:36:29] Using bower dir:  ./bower_components
    [13:36:29] Starting 'icons'...
    [13:36:29] Starting 'css'...
    [13:36:29] Starting 'js'...
    [13:36:29] Finished 'icons' after 775 ms
    [13:36:29] Finished 'js' after 767 ms
    [13:36:30] gulp-ruby-sass: directory
